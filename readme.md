# Multipass

A password manager using Web 1.0 technologies!  The most bestest & secure web technologies out there!!! (way better than that crappy 3.0 stuff)

Cannonical URL: http://www.serialhex.net/multipass/

## WAT?

It's a static HTML, CSS, Javascript site (really, just 1 CSS class, no that not so much) that allows you to generate a
handful of passwords using a simple memorable passphrase and not much else.

Maybe I'll say more later...
